# Analyzing NYC High School SAT Scores

## Summary
In this project, we investigated the correlation between SAT scores in NYC high schools and various demographics such as race, gender and income. All of the data sets used in this project have been taken from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/.

From our analysis, we concluded that:

- The best way to ensure that you are going to send your child to a high school in New York with high SAT scores is probably to send them to a school with a high proportion of White and Asian students. Schools that have a high proportion of Black and Hispanic students are likley to perform worse in SAT exams. Schools with large numbers of Black and Hispanic students are more likley to be unfunded, in low income areas and less likely to have the benefits of extra tution and private education etc.

- Schools that are considered to be safe and respectful by teachers, students and parents are more likley to perform better in SAT exams. High SAT scores are linked more closely to the safety and respect of schools than communication, engagement and academic expectations. 

- Schools with a higher proportion of females perform slightly better than majority male schools but the difference is small and gender is nowhere near as important to a schools SAT performance as ethnicicty.

- The NYC Borough with the highest performing schools is Satin Island and the lowest performing schools is The Bronx.

- Schools that have a higher proportion of AP students do not perform better in SAT exams. 

- Schools that have higher class sizes actually perform better in SAT exams than those that have smaller class sizes. This was a big surprise and upon further research is something that is not just confined to NYC. Perhaps, the idea of smaller class sizes equals academic success is not as accurate as previously thought.
